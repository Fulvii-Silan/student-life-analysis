## Day 1
Created project structure and set up environment.

Let me describe my project in a more thorough way. So

Nowadays, lots of students around the globe feel quite stressed and depressed. This often leads to burnout and procrastination. Even those who live in a decent environment have this issue. In my opinion, the reason for this, is the lack of self-reflection (including me actually). Young people do not like to admire their flaws, and it is OK. Maybe, we know we are not perfect, but can not really tell in which department we should be working on. Teenagers feel sad and irritated without a proper reason, or do they?
Maybe the issue is not really that deep, and changing everyday habits would be enough. 

Introducing to you - Burnout Getridder. This is the work that might be handy for someone. I would be very glad to know that it actually helped someone, genuinely.

Burnout Getridder is basically the code, which gives you some clues and conclusions according to the data you input. You put data such as Hours of sleep, hours of sport, entertainment. If you had an exam that day, or the weather was not the best, the burnout score changes accordingly. Good grades, on the other hand, decrease it.

After all of this, I plan to write the code so that it indicates on a factor that lacks your attention, and Getridder will give you a simple advice.


Homestly, I am not sure how long it is going to take. I have not got a faintest clue in the field of data analyst. This project is the pioneer.
I dont even know if I can cope with this.
So many ideas, zero knowledge. Let's see!


## Day 2
Learned basic Pandas library. Tested out how this works. Decided which factors exactly I am going to include in this project. 

To list, those  are:
    Student ID
    Day
    Hours of sleep
    Hours of sports (physical activity)
    Entertainment (includes TV, gaming, scrolling, etc.)
    Exam (true/false)
    Weather (No API for now, just good/bad)
    Grades of the following subjects:
        Math
        English Language
        Computer Science
        Social Studies
        Russian Language

Grades you get from the class also affect the score!

I got an idea to make a beautiful website, and import my code there. This way, it would me much more user-friendly and more convenient. Who wants to see their burnout score in a VS Code? No one I guess.


## Day 3
Decided not to write a CSV file first. I just wrote a sample input. Currently working out a formula which will calculate Burnout score according to the data.

Idea of creating a Website is under a huge quesion mark. I will need to learn HTML/CSS. Will I feel overwhelmed if I start making a website as well?

Instead of writing a separate CSV file, I just wrote the data directly in the file where analyze occurs. The main goal right now is to create a somewhat good calculations.

Tbf, I am stuck a little bit. Mainly because of non-acquantance with the library and its functions. How do I derive such a formula? 

Who explains if not my elder brother and Google.  XD



It seems good to add variations of models. Someone might not need Weather, but will need some other features. I am going to create several models.
